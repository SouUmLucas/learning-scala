## Learning Functional Programming with Scala

This repository contains a series of tutorials and exercises, covering the syntax of Scala programming language.

I'm also trying to cover all the fundamentals of functional paradigm.

In a near future I will commit some code examples about Machine Learning, using Apache Spark.
